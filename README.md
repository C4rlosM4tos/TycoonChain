WORK IN PROGRESS... DO NOT USE ANY OF THE CODE YET! very unSafu!











TycoonChain
Peer to peer Monopoly money

Digital cash used in a virtual environment 

Introduction
Why the need?
In our current situation we play monopoly at our home, we get rich and stop playing. We cannot join the game that the neighbor is hosting next door.
Many tycoon-style business games have the same problem. We play single-player, get rich and stop the game.
Thanks to blockchain technology we can solve this problem. 
TycoonChain uses smart contracts and locked-ups of pre-mined coins to create an ecosystem for tycoon-styled games. All those games have 1 big need, and that is currency coming out of thin air to reward the player for doing something. 
This is where the smart-contract ecosystems comes into play. 
All the pre-mined coins go into a staking contract. Every x-blocks a fixed reward should be shared between all holders of a stake. A stake is received by sending funds to the contract. Those funds are added to the contract, and in return they get a %-stake of all the future rewards to come. Those funds are a donation to the contract and cannot be withdrawn.
Technical
Under the hood the blockchain itself is just a version of Ethereum with an other genesis file basically. This coin itself is not having an ico or foundation, and comes with no promises. Having its own source-code would be the dream, but it would also require all 3th parties to also build their own products for it. Using Ethereum source-code allows using meta-mask and other services, its a matter of pointing those tool towards an other network. You could say that TycoonChain is just an other Ethereum testnet.
Why a new coin?
People have to be able to earn the coins in the games, and use them for transacting with the games. This means that they need to be able to earn the same currency as is required for the transactions fees. As a result I need to start a new blockchain, because miners on the main net will not accept tokens as payment for the gas (transaction fees)
The ecosystem 

The staking contract is the heart of the ecosystem.
Its created so games can sell objects for coins, and send those coins to the staking contract.  In return the game-contract gets a stake-reward, resulting in new coins for eternity*
Each gamecontract on this blockchain should have no owner. The coins belong to the game and its players. 
Example:
Lets assume we have a goldCrush game. Players just looking for gold in the ground with bulldozers and washplants. (browser based)
When players find gold-ore, they can melt it to gold-bars and sell them to the game-contract.
The game-contract can always buy gold, as it will receive coins for staking.
However, there is some natural selection. Unpopular games will get diluted fast, as other games burn more and more tokens for a bigger share. As a game-creator you have to find a balance in how much you let the game burn, and what you keep for yourself. Players will know this by reading the code. Greedy games will have it hard to get popular on this chain. 
Example:  
In the goldCrush example the coins paid for the bulldozer could flow to the staking-contract (or future funds for the game), but the fee paid for melting gold-ore to gold-bars could flow back to the creator of the game. Or maybe I keep the coins paid for the claims… 
There is also the option to just keep the funds in the game-contract without a stake, but then why use this blockchain in the first place?

The games are not around winning or losing, but about becoming the biggest tycoon. In reality players just battle the inflation and each other as they try to earn more than the inflation. Buying more claims and more bulldozers results in more and faster gold. Basically players try to drain the game-contract using game-objects, resulting in an infinite loop.  // warning, do not play the games if you’re easily addicted to things.
Not all games have to be never ending, but it is possible.

This ecosystem is not made for hodlers, but for active participants.  The inflation is backed by the ecosystems in the games, just like ponzi fiat is backed by the economy. The players have to keep growing or hyperinflation will settle in. Welcome in my virtual economy simulator, the entire ecosystem is one big game made out of smaller games. 
If Tycoin ever gets value in fiat then it just proves that fiat is monopoly money too.
